In this file, I will clarify the workflow for this branch. Only for spared-develop branch now.

'spared-develop' is a branch for tinier changes comparing to a commit on 'develop' branch.

Overall WorkFlow For 'spared-develop':

  Subject Template:

    Part 1:
      No.x for Base-Commit SHA.  like No.1 for 224e054d(first eight bits are enough)

    Part 2:
      Type & Subject             like 'Code-Change & Let Player In Home Page Game Walk'
        Type Contains:
          Base-Commit,  it clarifies the goal of the whole commit.
          Code-Change,  it adds function for Base-Commit.
          Code-Review,  it adds comments start with 'COMMENT: blablabla' for Last-Change.
          Final-Commit, it is the final version for Base-Commit, and it will be cherry-picked to 'develop' branch.
